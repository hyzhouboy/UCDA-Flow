# UCDA-Flow

Traning steps refer for train.sh.

Testing refers for demo.py.

We provide our collected real foggy images, namely [UCDA-Fog](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V41omr1_k_6OcVWfAhkvzbgSaUHM26tj/view?usp=sharing) dataset.

Moreover, we also provide the [pre-trained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1osPP1HAA-onkwmDMLUW_s95iEGaslA7R/view?usp=drive_link) for testing.
